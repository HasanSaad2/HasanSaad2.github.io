About Me
=====
Hi, I'm Hasan. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Louisiana State University under the mentorship of <a href = "https://www.math.lsu.edu/~llong/">Ling Long</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ft-tu/home">Fang-Ting Tu</a>. My interests lie in number theory, modular and harmonic Maass forms, and arithmetic statistics. Moreover, in addition to my research, I have experience in Machine Learning and Data Science. More precisely, through the Data Science Boot Camp at the Erd≈ës Institute, I developed a convolutional neural network model to detect AI-generated images.

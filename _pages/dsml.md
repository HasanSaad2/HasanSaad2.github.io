Project Description
----
The recent advances in deep learning, neural networks, and the hardware to support it have provided fertile ground for creating fake images. This new technology, if left unchallenged, creates a risk in multiple areas, including journalism, law enforcement, and knowledge itself. 	

We tackle this problem by constructing two multi-classification models (single-channel and dual-channel) to discern between real images and those which are generated by AI, and to determine which generative algorithm was used. Our model is trained on a publicly available dataset of approximately 90000 images. This dataset contains real images as well as images generated by 13 different CNN-based generative algorithms.
